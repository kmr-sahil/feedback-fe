# TrustFlag.in üö© ‚Äî A Trustpilot-like Review Platform

**TrustFlag.in** was an independent review platform aimed to bring transparent, user-generated feedback for businesses, similar to what Trustpilot offers.  
The platform allowed users to sign in with Google, search and review companies, and read customer feedback with ease.

Although the project has been discontinued due to lack of user traction, it remains a solid technical example of building a scalable review system using **Next.js**, **Tailwind**, **NextAuth**, and a Node.js backend.
